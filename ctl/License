2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights that This License grants to 
   any users or Providers of The Project (except when they have made an 
   unresolved breach to the terms and conditions of This License). You agree:  
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in 
       order to prevent or punish, any user or Providers, for 
       exercising their rights to This Project (including to any 
       Modifications You have made).
  
   (b) to irrevocably and automatically grant the required licenses 
       (including patent licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to every 
       Provider and/or user of This Project so that they may 
       exercise their rights to any Modifications You have made).

   (c) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way This License and/or 
       the Buildable Source of This Project and/or the ability for a 
       third-party to find, aquire and/or obtain it, either in bad faith, 
       and/or to circumvent the terms and conditions of This License.

3. When making Modifications to This Project You must decide whether or 
   not to become/remain a "Provider" and either:
   
   (a) You agree to become/remain a Provider. You must maintain Your Notice
       in The Attached Notices and for at least 30 days and as long as you 
       continue to offer any Derived Products, you must ensure the Buildable 
       Source for Your Derived Products are, Readibly Obtainable and 
       Clearly Discoverable, by the public.

   (b) You do not agree to become/remain a Provider and you omit/remove Your 
       Notice from The Attached Notices and you agree that This Project 
       (including any of Your Modifications) may be relicensed upon the 
       written agreement between each Provider under the terms of an agreed 
       upon Open Source License (or at any time if there are no Providers).

       the merge. You must make a reasonable effort to research and resolve 
       conflicts by awarding trademarks to the Trademark Owner (to your best 
       judgement). A trademark must not be removed from the Attached Notices
       in this way.

5. You may not use the name of any (other) Listed Providers nor any of their 
   Community Trademarks, to title, endorse or promote, any products, 
   projects, works, performances and/or services derived from, or otherwise

   (a) "Descriptive Fair Use" which means using dictionary words to 
       promote products, projects, works, performances and/or services, 
       derived from, and/or otherwise featuring This Project as long as 
       those words are used in good faith and for their natural meanings 
       and are not used in an attempt to capitalise on the reference to 
       any (other) Listed Provider's Community Trademarks.

   (b) "Nominative Fair Use" which means using a Provider's Community 
       Trademark to review and/or draw comparison to Derived Products.

   (c) "Contributing" which means that as long as your copy is a 
        Contribution you are not required to remove any Community 
        Trademarks that already exist in The Project (as you recieved it).
       
In the event that You breach a condition of This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach and, until You resolve this breach, 
any rights granted to You by This License (except for the rights to display 
and distribute The Buildable Source and Dependencies) are automatically 
terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to apply to 
You and any third-party who has agreed to This License, may, on behalf of

integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License, contact, sue,
