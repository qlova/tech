modify, display, perform, distribute, and/or otherwise exploit This Project for any 
purpose subject to the following conditions:

1. You must provide, on Request and/or clearly discoverable by any interested party, 
   the reasonable means for any party, who receives, interacts with, or observes, the 
   public display, feature, performance and/or otherwise availability of, Your copies 
   of This Project, to acquire the Source of these copies.  

2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights that This License grants to any party 
   unless that party has breached the conditions of This License. You agree:
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in order to 
       prevent or punish, any party, for exercising their rights to This Project 
       (including to any of the Modifications You have made).

   (b) to irrevocably and automatically grant any required licenses (including patent 
       licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to each Contributor and/or party so 
       that they may exercise their rights to any Modifications You have made).
   
   (c) to indemnify each Contributor and/or any party, against any litigation, damages 
       and/or penalties, arising from, trademark, copyright and/or patent infringement, 
       directly because of any Modifications You may have made.

   (d) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way the Source of This Project or the 
       ability for people to Request it, either in bad faith and/or to circumvent the 
       conditions of This License.

3. You may not modify This License except to add/reorder (and/or modify/remove but only 
   if You are the associated Contributor) valid Trademark Notices at the beginning of 
   This License. If You do not add any Trademark Notices to This License and/or You 
   remove Your Trademark Notices from This License, then You explicitly agree for This 
   Project to be relicensed at any time and under the terms of any chosen Open Source 
   License, upon the written agreement between each Contributor (or without any kind of
   agreement if there are zero Contributors).

4. You may not use the names of any Contributor nor any of their Community Trademarks to 
   title, endorse or promote, any products, projects, works, performances and/or services 
   derived from, or otherwise featuring This Project unless You have the prior written 
   consent from, or the publicly documented permission from, or You are, that Contributor.

   However this condition does not (and cannot) prevent You from:

      (a) using any standard dictionary words to promote Your products, projects, works, 
          performances and/or services, derived from, or otherwise featuring This 
          Project as long as these words are used sensibly for their natural language 
          meanings and do not function as a trademark, nor refer to any other 
          Contributor's Community Trademark.

      (b) using the names of any Contributors and/or any of their Community Trademarks, 
          to make strictly factual statements in any non-promotional settings including 
          but not limited to: credits, documents, blog posts, documentation, reports, 
          interviews etc. For example:
          '[product] was derived from/with [this project] developed by [contributor]'

      (c) "Making Contributions", which means that there will never be an obligation for 
          You to change the title of This Project (as you recieved it) as long as it is 
          clear to the public that it is Your copy of This Project and as long as the 
          existence of Your copies on a particular Distribution Channel would not prevent 
          or restrict any (other) Contributors from distributing This Project on that 
          Distribution Channel titled under any of their Community Trademarks.

In the event that You breach any of the conditions of This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach, and until You resolve this breach, any rights 
granted to You by This License (except for Corresponding Source distribution rights) 
are automatically terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to 
apply to You and any other party may, on behalf of each and every copyright holder, and 
only in good faith, to ensure the integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License, 
contact, sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek and collect damages from You. If any 
part of This License is declared unenforceable and/or invalid, the remainder will continue 
to be enforceable and valid.
