   feature, performance and/or otherwise availability of Your copies of This Project. 
   If you distribute a copy of This Project, your distribution must include Clearly 
   Discoverable instructions to aquire the Source of your copy.

2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights that This License grants to any users or
   Contributors of This Project (unless they have breached a condition of This License
   and it hasn't been resolved). You agree:
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in order to 
       prevent or punish, any user, for exercising their rights to This Project 
       (including to any Modifications You have made).

   (b) to irrevocably and automatically grant the required licenses (including patent 
       licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to every Contributor and/or user of This 
       Project so that they may exercise their rights to any Modifications You have made).
   
   (c) to indemnify each Contributor and/or user of This Project, against any litigation, 
       damages and/or penalties, arising from, trademark, copyright and/or patent 
       infringement, directly because of any Modifications You have made.

   (d) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way the Source of This Project or the 
       ability for a third-party to find or Request it, either in bad faith, and/or to 
       circumvent the conditions of This License.

3. You may not modify This License except to add/reorder (and/or modify/remove but only 
   if You are the associated Contributor) valid Trademark Notices at the beginning of 
   This License. If You do not add any Trademark Notices to This License and/or You 
   remove Your Trademark Notices from This License, then You explicitly agree that This 
   Project (including any Modifications You have made) may be relicensed at any time 
   under the terms of a chosen Open Source License upon the written agreement between 
   each Contributor (or without any kind of agreement if there are zero Contributors).

4. You may not use the names of any Contributors nor any of their Community Trademarks to 
   title, endorse or promote, any products, projects, works, performances and/or services 
   derived from, or otherwise featuring This Project unless You have the prior written 
   consent from, or the publicly documented permission of, or You are, that Contributor.

   However this condition does not (and cannot) prevent You from:

      (a) using any standard dictionary words to promote products, projects, works, 
          performances and/or services, derived from, or otherwise featuring The 
          Project as long as these words are used sensibly for their natural-language 
          meanings and do not function as a trademark, nor refer to any (other) 
          Contributor's Community Trademarks.

      (b) using the names of any Contributors and/or any of their Community Trademarks, 
          to make strictly factual statements in non-promotional settings including 
          but not limited to: credits, documents, blog posts, documentation, reports, 
          interviews etc. For example:
          '[product] was derived from/with [this project] developed by [contributor]'

      (c) "Making Contributions", which means that there can never be an obligation for 
          You to change the title of This Project (as you recieved it) as long as it is 
          clear to the public what Modifications You made (if any), and it's clear
          that it is Your copy of This Project, and and as long as the existence of any of 
          Your copies on a particular Distribution Channel would not prevent or restrict 
          any (other) Contributors from distributing This Project on that Distribution 
          Channel titled under any of their associated Community Trademarks.

In the event that You breach any of the conditions of This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach, and until You resolve this breach, any rights 
granted to You by This License (except for Corresponding Source distribution rights) 
are automatically terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to 
apply to You and any other party may, on behalf of each and every copyright holder, and 
only in good faith and to ensure the integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License,
