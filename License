The Qlovatech Community Trademark License 1.0
===============================================
Copyright (C) 2021 Qlova Limited <https://qlova.org>

You are hereby granted a universal non-exclusive right to, use, reproduce, 
make available, feature, modify, display, perform, distribute, and/or otherwise 
exploit This Project for *any purpose* subject to the following conditions:

1. If any third-party interacts with or observes (or is likely to interact with or
   observe), the display, feature, performance and/or otherwise availability of Your 
   copies of This Project. Then The Buildable Source of that copy (including any 
   Modifications you have made) must be made publicly available to, and/or Clearly 
   Discoverable by, any of those third-parties and licensed under the terms of This 
   License, so that any of those third-parties can aquire The Buildable Source at a 
   fee no more than the reasonable cost of distribution.

   When you distribute a copy of This Project, your distribution must include:
   
   (a) This License, Clearly Discoverable, and

   (b) The Attached Notices, Clearly Discoverable, and

   (c) The Buildable Source (including any Modifications you have made), and/or
       Clearly Discoverable instructions on how to aquire a publicly available
       copy of it, at a fee no more than the reasonable cost of distribution.

2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights that This License grants to any 
   users or Contributors of The Project (unless they have breached a condition of 
   This License and the breach hasn't been resolved). You agree:
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in order to 
       prevent or punish, any user or Contributor, for exercising their rights to 
       This Project (including to any Modifications You have made).

   (b) to irrevocably and automatically grant the required licenses (including 
       patent licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to every Contributor and/or 
       user of This Project so that they may exercise their rights to any of the 
       Modifications You made).
   
   (c) to indemnify each and every Contributor and/or user of This Project, against 
       any litigation, damages and/or penalties, arising from, trademark, copyright 
       and/or patent infringement, directly arising from any of Your Modifications.

   (d) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way This License and/or the Buildable
       Source of This Project and/or the ability for a third-party to find or aquire it, 
       either in bad faith, and/or to circumvent the conditions of This License.

3. If You do not add Trademark Notices to The Attached Notices and/or You remove 
   Your Trademark Notices from This Project, then this signals that You explicitly 
   agree that This Project (including any Modifications You have made) can be 
   relicensed at any time, under the terms of a chosen Open Source License upon the 
   written agreement between each Contributor (or without any kind of agreement if 
   there are zero Contributors).

   You must "Preserve The Attached Notices" which means you cannot modify The 
   Attached Notices except to:

   (a) Add/change/remove Your Trademark Notices.

   (c) Reorder the Trademark Notices.

   (d) Copy in Trademark Notices verbatim from another work and/or from a modified 
       version of The Attached Notices.

4. You may not use the name of any Contributor nor any of their Community Trademarks 
   (that are listed in The Attached Notices), to title, endorse or promote, any 
   products, projects, works, performances and/or services derived from, or
   otherwise featuring This Project unless You have the prior written consent from, 
   or the publicly documented permission of, or You are, that Contributor.

   However this condition cannot (and does not) prevent You from:

   (a) using dictionary words to promote products, projects, works, performances 
       and/or services, derived from, and/or otherwise featuring This Project as 
       long as those words are used in good faith and for their natural meanings 
       and they are not used in an attempt to capitalise on any (other) 
       Contributor's Community Trademarks.

   (b) "Forking The Project", which means that You will never have an obligation 
        to change the title of This Project (as You have recieved it) as long as any 
        Modifications you have made are documented to the public and it is clear that 
        this copy of The Project is Your copy, and as long as the existence of any of 
        Your copies of This Project on a particular Distribution Channel would not 
        prevent or restrict any (other) existing Contributors from distributing This 
        Project on that Distribution Channel titled under any of their associated 
        Community Trademarks.

In the event that You breach a condition of This License, You must take immediate 
steps (as soon as you are aware) to resolve this breach and, until You resolve 
this breach, any rights granted to You by This License (except for the rights to 
display and distribute The Buildable Source) are automatically terminated, however, 
the conditions of This License will continue to apply to You and any third-party who
has agreed to This License, may, on behalf of each copyright holder, and only in 
good faith and to ensure the fairness, integrity, precedent and/or compliance of 
This License, contact, sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek and collect 
damages from You.

   (a) "Platform Provided Works", which means any work that is provided by a 
        third-party Platform or its owner (including but not limited to, the Platform

        that is designed to allow third-party works to be Operated on that Platform.

   (b) "Platform Protected Work", which means any part of The Project that is 
        protected from disclosure or distribution because of an agreement with the 
        owner of a third-party Platform, such that this part of the work only serves

        order to enable The Project to be Operated on that Platform.

   (c) "External Work", which means any work where the preferred form of making

 is preceded by zero or more comma-separated trademarks and preceeds zero or more
 comma seperated contact details (such as an Email Address). Each trademark is 
 associated with the copyright holder that added that copyright notice (it is theirs), 
 and each trademark added this way is considered to be a "Community Trademark" when:

   (a) it is the appropriate legal representation of a trademark, or is a term or 
       phrase followed by, the unicode trademark symbol, '(TM)' or '(R)', and

   (b) it is clearly distinguishable (by a reasonable person) from any other
       previously added Community Trademarks by any other Contributor, and

   (c) it was added in good faith and represents a genuine mark that is being used by 
       the Contributor to title products, projects, works, performances and/or services.
