   the reasonable means for any party, who receives, interacts with, or observes, the

   of This Project, to acquire the Source of these copies licensed under the terms of
   This License.

   party unless that party has breached the conditions of This License. You agree:
   
   (a) not to sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek damages from, in order to 
       prevent or punish, any party, for exercising their rights to This Project 
       (including to any of the Modifications You have made).

   (b) to, at no cost, fee nor royalty, irrevocably and automatically grant any 
       required licenses (including patent licenses) to each Contributor and/or party 
       so that they may exercise their rights to any Modifications you have made).
   
   (c) to indemnify each Contributor and/or any party, against any litigation, damages 
       and/or penalties, arising from, trademark, copyright and/or patent infringement, 
       directly because of any Modifications You have made.

   (d) not to obfuscate, omit, or obstruct in any way the Source of This Project or the 
       ability for people to Request it, either in bad faith and/or to circumvent the 
       conditions of This License.

3. You may not modify This License except to add/reorder (and/or modify/remove but only if 
   You are the associated Contributor) valid Trademark Notices at the beginning of 
   This License. If You do not add any Trademark Notices to This License and/or You 
   remove Your Trademark Notices from This License, then You explicitly agree for This 
   Project to be relicensed at any time and under the terms of any chosen Open Source 
   License, upon the written agreement between each Contributor (or without any kind of
   agreement if there are zero Contributors).

4. You may not use the names of any Contributor nor any of the Community Trademarks 
   that are associated to that Contributor in This License, to title, endorse or promote, 
   any products, projects, works, performances and/or services derived from, or otherwise 
   featuring This Project unless You have the prior written consent from, or the 
   publicly documented permission from, or You are, that Contributor.

   However this condition does not (and cannot) prevent You from:

      (a) using any standard dictionary words to promote Your products, projects, works, 
          performances and/or services, derived from, or otherwise featuring This 
          Project as long as these words are used sensibly for their natural language 
          meanings and do not function as a trademark, nor refer to any of the Community 
          Trademarks listed in this license by any (other) Contributor.

      (b) using the names of any Contributors and/or any Community Trademarks listed in 
          this license, to make strictly factual statements in any non-promotional 
          settings including but not limited to: credits, documents, blog posts, 
          documentation, reports, interviews etc. For example:
          '[product] was derived from/with [this project] developed by [contributor]'

      (c) "Making Contributions", which means that there will never be an obligation for 
          You to change the title of the Corresponding Source (as you recieved it) as 
          long as it is clear to the public that, this is Your copy of the Corresponding
          Source and as long as the existence of Your copy on a particular Distribution 
          Channel would not prevent or restrict any (other) Contributors from distributing 
          This Project on that Distribution Channel titled under a Community Trademark that 
          is associated to that Contributor in This License.

In the event that You breach any of the conditions in This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach and until You resolve this breach, any rights 
granted to You by This License (except for Corresponding Source distribution rights) 
are automatically terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to 
apply to You and any party may, on behalf of each and every copyright holder, and only in 
good faith, to ensure the integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License, contact, 
sue, litigate against and/or otherwise seek and collect damages from You. If any part of 
This License is declared unenforceable and/or invalid, the remainder will continue to be 
enforceable and valid.
