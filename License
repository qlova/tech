Everyone has the universal right to modify, use, copy and/or distribute this software 
subject to the following conditions:

1. You must provide, on Request, clearly attached to your copy and/or easily discoverable
   by any interested party, the reasonable means for anyone 'receiving', 'interacting with', 
   or 'observing the public display, performance or otherwise availability of' your copies of 
   this software, to acquire the Corresponding Source of these copies (including any modifications 
   you made) under the terms of this license. 

   "Request" means any appropriate and/or standard method to ask, request, or otherwise 
   query you for the Available Source of any relevant product, service, distribution,
   display and/or performance.
   
   "Available Source" means any formal, legal or colloquially understood term to describe 
   Corresponding Source including but not limited to the terms 'open source', 
   'free software' and 'source available'.

   "Corresponding Source" means the preferred form of making changes to this software 
   and includes this license, any disclaimers, copyright notices and readme instructions. 
   However, the Corresponding Source need not include any separable larger work that this 
   software is embedded in (and not dependant on), nor any generally available open source 
   software, nor any compiler and/or platform-specific software that only serves to implement a 
   low-level general interface so that this software can be ported, run and/or distributed on a 
   particular distribution platform, product, software interpreter, or operating system.

   You may not attempt to circumvent this condition in any way, including but not limited to:

      (a) obfuscation and/or omission (any additional subdirectories or files you add
          to the Corresponding Source is as a modification of this software and 
          must be included as such).
      
      (b) copyright infringement (if you extract any file or subdirectory from this software 
          and you embed it inside of a larger work modified in such a way that this software 
          now depends on the larger work and cannot be meaningfully seperated from it without 
          modification, then the Corresponding Source of this software must also include the 
          Corresponding Source of the larger work under the terms of this license).

2. You may not restrict in any way, any rights that this license grants. You agree:
   
      (a) not to sue, litigate against or otherwise seek damages in order to prevent or 
      punish anyone for exercising their rights to this software (including to any 
      modifications you have made).
      
      (b) to indemnify any copyright holders and users of this software against 
      any litigation of trademark, copyright or patent infringement directly due
      to any modifications you have made to this software.

3. You may not modify this license except to add (and/or remove but only if you are the 
   rightful copyright holder) valid Trademark Notices to the list at the top of this license. 

   "Trademark Notices" means a copyright notice in this license preceded by zero or more 
   comma-seperated trademarks and is only valid when:

      (a) each trademark is followed by a unicode trademark symbol, '(TM)', '(R)' or is 
          otherwise an appropriate legal representation for a trademark.

      (c) each trademark is unique inside this license, it does not appear in any other 
          copyright holder's Trademark Notices.

      (d) each trademark is clearly distinguishable (by a reasonable person) from any 
          other trademarks listed by any other copyright holders.

      (e) the trademark was added in good faith and represents a genuine mark that is being 
          used by the copyright holder for a product, project, software and/or service.

      (f) each trademark was added by the copyright holder specified in the copyright notice.

   If you do not add any Trademark Notices or remove your Trademark Notices from this license
   then you agree that this software may be relicensed at any time under the terms of a license 
   approved by the Open Source Initiative (https://opensource.org/) and with the written agreement 
   between each listed copyright holder in this license (if there are no copyright holders listed
   in this license, no written agreement is required).

4. You may not use the names of any copyright holders or any of the listed trademark in this license 
   to title, endorse or promote, any products, projects and/or services derived from this software 
   unless you have prior written consent from (or you are) the copyright holder who added the relevant 
   trademark to this license.

   However, this condition cannot prevent you from:

      (a) using any standard dictionary words to promote your products, projects and/or services 
          as long as these words are used sensibly for their natural meanings in the language 
          and do not function as a trademark or refering to a trademark listed in this license.

      (b) using the names of copyright holders and/or any trademarks listed in this license
          to make factual statements in a non-promotional setting such as: credit or about 
          sections, documentation, blog posts, reports, interviews etc. For example:
          '[product] was derived/built from/with [this software] developed by [copyright holder]'

      (c) "Making Contributions" which means that you can publicly display, distribute and modify the 
          Corresponding Source of this software without changing the title as long as it is clear 
          to the public who owns this copy and you otherwise comply with section 4.

In the event of a breach of this license, any single (or party of) copyright holder(s) of this software 
can (on behalf of all copyright holders) and only to ensure the integrity, precedent and compliance 
of this license, contact, sue, litigate against or otherwise seek and collect damages from you. 
If any part of this license is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be 
valid and enforceable.
