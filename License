You are hereby granted a universal non-exclusive right to, use, reproduce, 
make available, feature, modify, display, perform, distribute, and/or 
otherwise exploit Your copy of This Project for *any purpose* subject to 
the following conditions:
      
1. If at any time, You Share a copy of This Project (with or without 
   Modifications) to any third party (and You are not making an Official 
   Release) then You must ensure that The Source Code, The License and 
   Dependencies of that copy are Readily Obtainable and Clearly 
   Discoverable by that third party for at least 30 days after you 
   last Shared this copy of The Project to them.
   
2. You may not restrict in any way, the rights This License grants to 
   any users or Publishers of The Project (except when they have made an 
   unresolved breach to the terms and conditions of This License). 
   You agree:  
  
   (a) to irrevocably and automatically grant any required licenses 
       (including patent licenses), at no cost, fee, nor royalty to every 
       Publisher and/or user of This Project so that they may 
       exercise their rights to any Modifications You may have made.

   (b) not to obfuscate, omit, and/or obstruct in any way This License, The 
       Source Code and/or Dependencies of This Project and/or the ability 
       for a third party to find, acquire and/or obtain it, either in bad 
       faith, and/or to circumvent the terms and conditions of This License.

3. When making Modifications to This Project You must decide whether or 
   not to become or remain a Publisher and either:
   
   (a) You agree to become or remain a Publisher and You agree to maintain 
       Your Notice in The Attached Notices and, for at least 30 days, and 
       as long as You continue to make Official Releases to third parties, 
       You must ensure that The Source Code of Your Official Releases are, 
       Readily Obtainable and Clearly Discoverable, by the general public.

   (b) You do not agree to become or remain a Publisher and You agree, to 
       omit/remove Your Notice from The Attached Notices and agree that 
       This Project (including any Modifications You may have made) may 
       be relicensed upon the written agreement between each Publisher 
       under the terms of an agreed upon Open Source License (or at any 
       time if there are no Publishers). 

4. You may not modify the Attached Notices, except to:

   (a) Add/modify/remove Your Notice.

   (b) Reorder, relocate and/or format the Notices.

   (c) Modify/remove a Notice with written consent from the Notice's
       copyright holder.

   (d) Merge Notices verbatim with another set of Notices. Each Community 
       Trademark before the merge must remain a Community Trademark after
       the merge, so you must make a reasonable effort to research and 
       resolve conflicts by awarding the trademarks to the Trademark Owner 
       (to Your best judgement). A trademark may not be removed from the 
       Attached Notices this way.

5. You may not use the name of any (other) Publishers nor any of their 
   Community Trademarks, to title, endorse or promote, any of Your products, 
   projects, works, performances and/or services derived from, or otherwise 
   featuring This Project unless You have the prior written consent from, 
   or the publicly documented permission from the Publisher.

   However this condition cannot (and does not) prevent You from:

   (a) "Descriptive Fair Use" which means using dictionary words to 
       promote products, projects, works, performances and/or services, 
       derived from, and/or otherwise featuring This Project as long as 
       those words are used in good faith and for their natural meanings 
       and are not used in an attempt to capitalise on the reference to 
       any (other) Publisher's Community Trademarks.

   (b) "Nominative Fair Use" which means using a Publisher's Community 
       Trademark to review and/or fairly draw comparison to one of 
       their Official Releases.

   (c) "Contributing" which means that as long as Your copy remains a 
        Contribution You are not required to remove any Community 
        Trademarks that existed in The Project (as You received it)
        in order to Share it.
       
In the event that You breach a condition of This License, You must take 
immediate steps to resolve this breach and, until You resolve this breach, 
any rights granted to You by This License (except for the rights to display 
and distribute The Source Code and Dependencies) are automatically 
terminated, however, the conditions of This License will continue to apply to 
You and any third party who has agreed to This License, may, on behalf of

integrity, precedent and/or compliance of This License, contact, sue, 
litigate against and/or otherwise seek and collect damages from You.

       be used for a Derived Product.
