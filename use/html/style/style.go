/*
	Package style provides the HTML <style> element.

	The <style> HTML element contains style information for a document,
	or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the
	contents of the document containing the <style> element.

	The <style> element must be included inside the <head> of the document.
	In general, it is better to put your styles in external stylesheets
	and apply them using <link> elements.

	If you include multiple <style> and <link> elements in your document,
	they will be applied to the DOM in the order they are included in
	the document â€” make sure you include them in the correct order,
	to avoid unexpected cascade issues.

	In the same manner as <link> elements, <style> elements can include
	media attributes that contain media queries, allowing you to
	selectively apply internal stylesheets to your document depending
	on media features such as viewport width.
