Everyone has the universal right to modify, run and copy this software for personal use.
Additionally, anyone may reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, 
and otherwise exploit this software for any purpose subject to the following conditions:

1. You must provide either on request or through public documentation, anybody 'receiving', 
   'interacting with', or 'observing the public display, performance or availability of' 
   your copies of this software with timely and reasonable means to acquire the corresponding 
   source-code, disclaimers & copyright notices of these copies (including any modifications 
   you have made) under the terms of this license. The "corresponding source-code" is the 
   preferred form of making changes to this software and includes basic documentation 
   and any readme instructions. However, the corresponding source-code need not include any 
   separable larger work that this software is embedded in (and not dependant on), nor any 
   generally available open source software, nor any compiler and/or platform-specific 
   software that only serves to implement a low-level general interface so that this software 
   can be ported, run and/or distributed on a particular distribution platform, product, 
   software interpreter, or operating system.

2. You may not attempt to restrict the rights and/or grants this license gives to others.
   This means you agree not to sue, litigate against or otherwise seek damages in order
   to prevent or punish anyone for exercising their rights to this software (including to
   any modifications you have made). Additionally, you agree to indemnify the copyright 
   holders of this software against any litigation of copyright or patent infringement 
   arising because of the modifications you made to this software. You agree to not circumvent 
   your responsibilities from term 1 of this license through obfuscation and/or omission 
   (adding any additional subdirectories or files to the corresponding source-code is a 
   modification and must be included). If you extract any file or subdirectory from this 
   software and you embed it modified inside of a larger work so that this software depends
   on the larger work then the larger work that this software has been modified to depend on 
   must also be included in the corresponding source-code under the terms of this licence.

3. You may not modify this license except to add (and/or remove but only if you are the 
   rightful copyright holder) copyright notices and (optional) comma-separated trademark 
   declarations subject to the condition that there are no conflicting trademark notices. 
   Each trademark must be declared by exactly one copyright holder. Additionally, any new 
   trademark notices should be easily distinguishable (by a reasonable person) from any
   trademark notices by any other of the listed copyright holders. If you omit or remove your 
   copyright notice then you agree that any modifications you made to this software can be
   relicensed under the terms of an open source license upon the written agreement between 
   every listed copyright holder. If the list is too large for your taste, you may create a 
   Contributors/Authors file to record future additions to these license terms. You must ensure
   there is always at least one copyright notice listed by this license and any trademarks you 
   declare must be in good faith and represent genuine marks that you are using for a product, 
   project, software or service.

4. You may not use the names of any copyright holders, nor any of their declared trademarks 
   (as declared in this license and Contributors/Authors file), to title, endorse, or promote 
   products, projects and/or services derived from this software without prior written consent 
   from (or unless you are) the associated copyright holder. This has one exception, you may 
   publicly fork this software as-is without changing the title of this software as long as: 
   it is clear to the public that it is your fork, you have not added any copyright notices 
   to this license, and you do not publicly promote this fork (except optionally to the listed 
   copyright holders so that they can merge your changes). This condition doesn't prevent you 
   from using any standard dictionary words to promote your products, projects and/or services 
   as long as you do not mean for those words to refer to a declared trademark. Additionally,
   this condition does not prevent you from using the names of copyright holders and/or declared 
   trademarks to make factual statements in any non-promotional setting such as: credit or
   about sections, documentation, blog posts, reports, interviews etc. For example:
   '[product] was derived/built from/with [this software] created by [the copyright holder]'

Any single (or party of) copyright holder(s) of this software, to ensure that 
you comply with the terms and conditions of this license may contact, sue, litigate against or 
otherwise seek damages against you (on behalf of all the copyright holders) if you breach 
the terms and conditions of this license. If any part of this license is declared unenforceable 
or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.
